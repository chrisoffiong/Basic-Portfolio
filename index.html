         Hello! My name is Christopher Offiong, and I have created <br> 
        this website to tell you a little about myself. I'm currently <br> 
        27  years old and I am now enrolled in a coding bootcamp <br>
        at  Georgia Tech. I am fasctinated with the <br> 
        idea of learning everything there is about not only <br>
        front end, but back end web development that is <br>
        being offered there. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Through the use of this course I feel as though I can better myself not only in the tech <br> 
        field, but also as a person! I hope that I can share experiences with  my teachers,<br>
        TAs and classmate on this journey that we all have taken part of!
